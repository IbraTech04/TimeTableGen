# timeTableGen
timeTableGen was an app developed to help students navigate the unnecessarily complicated COVID-19 schedules at school. It is currently in the process of being ported over to use my new ProcessingClickableElements library
 # Features
 ## Custom Date Lookup
 timeTableGen supports checking other days, other than today. By clicking the calendar in the bottom-right and typing in a date (example: 04/20), or using a shortcut (wed, next wed, tomorrow), the program will display your schedule for that day
 
 ## Themes and Color Schemes
 Similar to TMQM, timeTableGen supports Dynamic and custimazable themes. Chose from Dark, Light, Really Dark, Really Light, and Blue, Red, Green, Purple, Orange, or Turquoise
